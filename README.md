## My professional website / portfolio

Repository of the project for my own professional website and online portfolio. This is as well the semester project for Spring 2020 from CODE University of Applied Sciences. The project is divided in three main parts:

**Landing page** Welcoming section, with a logo, automated scrolling (custom made with JS as Safari doesn't support built in smooth scrolling) to a small intro. On the bottom of the page there's animated artwork, custom made with JS to give parallax effect on mouse hover.

**About** One of the two slide over pages. Animated with JS. Mostly static text.

**Works** The second slide over page. Includes a collection of six highlighted works I've done in the last year. Fully responsive using grids. On hover each card shows a preview of the project with a link to its GitHub repository.

### Status
Live [here](https://valentin.work)

### Technologies 
Built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, I challenged myself to use no dependencies or frameworks to really dig deep on the basics of the language.

### Cloning or downloading: 
The projects uses no external libraries or dependencies, therefore it needs no special installation instructions. Just clone it or download the zip and you're ready to go!

### Responsive
The website is fully responsive and adapted to both mobile and desktop.
